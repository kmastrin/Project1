		<div class="text"><h3>Sammy is a 6 year old tabby, she was adopted when she was
6 months old. We estimated when her birthday was, so we
celebrate on March 13th every year! She is very cuddly and loves attention (not like other cats), especially if she gets treats with her pets.</h3>
			<p>Having a cat will come with a self-sufficient pet that will meow at you for attention. Most cats just like the company, not so much for being held or given tons of attention all the time. They also have a very good memory and become your new alarm clock in the morning to be fed!</p>
